# engram — working rules

- Read `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md`, then the newest `.ai/decisions/`, before changing code.
- Run `npm test` before claiming a change works; `npm run typecheck` for types.
- Run `engram dump` when you need project state; it is the only context you should preload.
- Never edit text between `<!-- engram:contract:start -->` and `<!-- engram:contract:end -->`.
- Edit `.ai/skills/<name>.md` and run `engram sync` — never the carriers under `.claude/`, `.pi/`,
  `.cursor/`, `.gemini/`, `.github/prompts/`.
- Add a runtime dependency only after a decision record in `.ai/decisions/` says why.
- Write a pitfall to `.ai/pitfalls/cases/` when a fix is non-obvious, with a guard.

## Project memory bank (`.ai/`) — required contract

This repository keeps a portable, tool-independent memory bank in `.ai/`. It outranks chat
history and your own recollection. Read it on demand with file tools; never paste it wholesale.

### Read before you act

1. `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` — the current goal, in-progress state and blockers. Read this first.
2. Newest-first scan of `.ai/decisions/` for `💭 PROPOSAL` / `✅ ACCEPTED` entries that touch
   your task. An accepted decision is binding; a proposal needs a verdict, not silent adoption.

### Read on demand (trigger → file, not a bulk preload)

| Trigger | Read |
| --- | --- |
| changing architecture, stack, module boundaries | `.ai/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| deploy, env vars, CI, incidents, ops | `.ai/runbooks/<topic>.md` |
| a bug that feels familiar / "we fixed this before" | `.ai/pitfalls/cases/<case>.md` |
| resuming after context loss, compaction or a long session | newest `.ai/sessions/*-handoff.md` |
| brainstorming a direction, before writing code | `.ai/decisions/` (write a `💭 PROPOSAL`) |

### Write back (not optional)

| Event | Write |
| --- | --- |
| a choice that is expensive to reverse | `.ai/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` via `/remember-decision` |
| a pitfall you hit, or a silent failure mode you decoded | `.ai/pitfalls/cases/<case>.md` via `/remember-pitfall` |
| ending a session with unfinished or fragile work | `.ai/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-handoff.md` via `/handoff` |
| any change to goal, state or blockers | `.ai/CURRENT_TASK.md` (same edit turn, never "later") |

Rules of the bank:

- One file per topic, `YYYY-MM-DD-<kebab-topic>.md`, status header on line 1 of the body:
  `💭 PROPOSAL` → `✅ ACCEPTED` → `🪦 REJECTED`. Flip the status, never rewrite history.
- Keep entries short and factual. The bank is an index of decisions, not a diary.
- Canonical skill specs live in `.ai/skills/*.md`. If your tool can load them, load them; if
  it cannot, this table is the fallback contract — follow it literally.
- If the bank and the code disagree, the bank is stale: fix the bank in the same change.
